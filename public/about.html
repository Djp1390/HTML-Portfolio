<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 23-year-old aspiring Web Developer. I am currently working on getting my certifications to be a Full-Stack Web Developer.
Currently, I am working on learning HTML, CSS, JS, Node, React, PostgreSQL, Web3, and DApps.
I hope to one day become a great Full-Stack Web Developer as well as learn more computer science-based skills such as CyberSecurity
to build a better future with technology.</p>

<p>Besides learning Computer-Science, I love to cook, produce music, and game. Some of my best dishes are Steak, Beef Wellington, 
and Chicken Alfredo, and Beef and Pork Lumpia! I love to produce all types of music, and am currently really loving Shoegaze and Dream Pop!
Some games I enjoying playing are Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Fortnite! </p>

<p>I am always open to team-based projects and love to lead. However, that doesn't mean I don't take direction well. I love to lead teams to
success as well as learn new things along the way to strengthen my skills as a leader, as well as a person.</p>
